Technical Task: Deploy an application via Orchestration/Infrastructure Configuration

 

The purpose of this exercise is to show how to automatically deploy an application in multiple systems for scalability purposes. You can use any tools you want to do this exercise (scripts, python, ansible, AWS Cloud Formation, Azure Resource Manager Templates etc.) We have published a sample application here: https://github.com/nmenant/basic-app. This repository contains a python-based web application and the relevant Dockerfile to deploy it in a container. Feel free to use any other web-based application for this exercise if you prefer.  No database is necessary for this deployment (optional if you would like to include it)

 

Required components/outcome

An available functioning website/application (preferably in a public cloud)
Where there are at least 2 VMs/EC2/containers instances running the website
You’ll need to install automatically the required tools on the systems hosting the application
You’ll need to deploy automatically the application you want to leverage
No manual intervention is expected during the deployment process
 

 

If you are not able to fulfill all the requirements it is not considered failure. If you want to enhance the application/solution, feel free to do so. The purpose of this exercise is to see:

How you approach the problem
What you would adapt / change to improve the solution in the future
How you update the systems and deploy the application in an orchestrated manner
